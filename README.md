I'm a machine learning enthusiasts who enjoys participating in data science competitions and using machine learning techniques to solve interesting problems. I'm also a Web Developer who enjoys building web applications to help my community. I'm currently an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, completing a Double Degree Programme in Mathematics and Computer Science.

### ðŸ‘· Machine Learning Projects

- \[[Simple Maths Expression Solver](https://github.com/Joseph31416/Simple-Maths-Expression-Solver)\] A web application that takes in a photo of a simple handwritten mathematical expression and evaluates the numeric answer. The neural network uses CNN layers and has an architecture that is inspired from the VGG-16 architecture.
- \[[Address Extraction](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ek7UeljG5Ps92QmEy3np4qY6nlDPLomd?usp=sharing)\] A neural network is built using the BERT model to extract street names and point of interests from a dataset containing messy Indonesian addresses. 
- \[[Stock Prices Analysis]()\] By engineering features from historical data, a neural network is built to predict the short-term trend of a particular stock. (Work in progress)

### ðŸŒ± Web Applications

- \[[Registration Platform](https://fbc-registration.herokuapp.com/)\] A web application that is built during the Covid-19 pandemic to help a church in Malaysia to keep track of the number of people who will be attending the physical Sunday worship service. 
- \[[Centralised Database](https://kangenlibrary.herokuapp.com/)\] A web application that is built to aid a company to share training resources with the rest of their employees. The web application automatically synchronises the resources uploaded to Google Drive by the admin.
