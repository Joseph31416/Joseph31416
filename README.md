I'm an AI enthusiasts who enjoys participating in data science competitions and using machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve interesting problems. I'm also a developer who enjoys building applications to help my community. I'm currently an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, pursuing a Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. My current research interest is in copyright protection in the field of generative AI.

### ðŸ“š Research Projects
- \[[Investigating Copyright Issues of Diffusion Models under Practical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12803)\] An automated pipeline is built to create a dataset that tests for copyright infringement issues within the latest Stable Diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion XL. We published our results to show that even the most cutting-edge Stable Diffusion model suffers from the problem of generating copyrighted content.

### ðŸ’» Deep Learning Projects

- \[[Simple Maths Expression Solver](https://github.com/Joseph31416/Simple-Maths-Expression-Solver)\] A web application that takes in a photo of a simple handwritten mathematical expression and evaluates the numeric answer. The neural network uses CNN layers and has an architecture that is inspired from the VGG-16 architecture.
- \[[Address Extraction](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ek7UeljG5Ps92QmEy3np4qY6nlDPLomd?usp=sharing)\] A neural network is built using the BERT model to extract street names and point of interests from a dataset containing messy Indonesian addresses. 
- \[[Stock Prices Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eZI0l0puiIKqynxwCmcWdHGeojQPgYG5?usp=sharing)\] By engineering features from historical data, a neural network using 1D-CNN and LSTM layers is built to predict the short-term trend of a particular stock's price. 

### ðŸ•¸ Web Applications

- \[[Registration Platform](https://fbc-registration.herokuapp.com/)\] A web application that is built during the Covid-19 pandemic to help a church to keep track of the number of people who will be attending the physical Sunday worship service. 
- \[[Centralised Database](https://kangenlibrary.herokuapp.com/)\] A web application that is built to aid a company to share training resources with the rest of their employees. The web application automatically synchronises the resources uploaded to Google Drive by the admin. 
- \[[Bus Search](https://github.com/Joseph31416/NYJC-JC2-Capstone-project-Bus-search)\] A web application that displays the cheapest and shortest route between two bus stops in Singapore.

### ðŸŽ¤ Discord Bots
- \[[Productivity Bot](https://github.com/Joseph31416/Discord-ProductivityTrackerBot)\] A discord bot that keeps track of the number of hours put into working/studying through a clocking in and out system. A leaderboard ranked by hours of work done can be generated by the admin through the bot.
