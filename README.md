I'm an AI enthusiasts who enjoys participating in data science competitions and using machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve interesting problems. I'm also a developer who enjoys building applications to help my community. I'm currently an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, pursuing a Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. My current research interest is in copyright protection in the field of generative AI.

- \[[Enhancing Semantic Fidelity in Text-to-Image Synthesis: Attention Regulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06381)\] Recent advancements in diffusion models have notably improved the perceptual quality of generated images in text-to-image synthesis tasks. However, diffusion models often struggle to produce images that accurately reflect the intended semantics of the associated text prompts. We examine cross-attention layers in diffusion models and observe a propensity for these layers to disproportionately focus on certain tokens during the generation process, thereby undermining semantic fidelity. To address the issue of dominant attention, we introduce attention regulation, a computation-efficient on-the-fly optimization approach at inference time to align attention maps with the input text prompt. Notably, our method requires no additional training or fine-tuning and serves as a plug-in module on a model. Hence, the generation capacity of the original model is fully preserved. We compare our approach with alternative approaches across various datasets, evaluation metrics, and diffusion models. Experiment results show that our method consistently outperforms other baselines, yielding images that more faithfully reflect the desired concepts with reduced computation overhead. Code is available [here](https://github.com/YaNgZhAnG-V5/attention_regulation).

- \[[Investigating Copyright Issues of Diffusion Models under Practical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12803)\] Diffusion models excel in many generative modeling tasks, notably in creating images from text prompts, a task referred to as text-to-image (T2I) generation. Despite the ability to generate high-quality images, these models often replicate elements from their training data, leading to increasing copyright concerns in real applications in recent years. In response to this raising concern about copyright infringement, recent studies have studied the copyright behavior of diffusion models when using direct, copyrighted prompts. Our research extends this by examining subtler forms of infringement, where even indirect prompts can trigger copyright issues. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline to systematically produce data for studying copyright in diffusion models. Our pipeline enables us to investigate copyright infringement in a more practical setting, involving replicating visual features rather than entire works using seemingly irrelevant prompts for T2I generation. We generate data using our proposed pipeline to test various diffusion models, including the latest Stable Diffusion XL. Our findings reveal a widespread tendency that these models tend to produce copyright-infringing content, highlighting a significant challenge in this field.
